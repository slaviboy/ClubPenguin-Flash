- finish AS2 Puffle handlers
- card-jitsu handlers (from what I'm guessing, could take a while)
- treasure hunt (we need packet dumps from club penguin, I cannot make any sense of this from the client code)
- AS2 moderation handlers
- ignore list functionality (don't show ignored players, disable postcards ect)
- monthly postcard payments
- multiplayer tables send you back to the previous room
